# MochiComics
A prototype for a modular web-novel hosting website. 

Inspired by [WitchCultTranslations](https://witchculttranslation.com/), a website hosting english translations of the popular Japanese web-novel Re:Zero.

The prototype is mostly complete in terms of functionality for both mobile  & desktop.


## Current functionality
* NodeJS & EJS comic loader based of formatted TXT files downloaded from a source like Google Docs
* Front page displaying latest chapters posted, and featured web-novels
* Individual novel landing pages displaying all chapters
* Semi-user-friendly pages for each chapter

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)
